# Boom Wipe - High-Intensity Data Destruction System

## üöÄ Overview

The Boom Wipe system provides **high-intensity, military-grade data destruction** using a revolutionary "bomb placement" methodology. This system is designed for scenarios requiring immediate and forceful data destruction with maximum security.

## üí£ How Boom Wipe Works

### The Bomb Method
1. **Memory Bomb Placement**: The system strategically places "bombs" across the storage device
2. **Optimized Coverage**: Each bomb covers a specific memory sector to ensure complete coverage
3. **Parallel Detonation**: Multiple bombs detonate simultaneously using multi-threading
4. **Triple Overwrite**: Each bomb performs 3 overwrite passes:
   - **Pass 1**: All zeros (`0x00`)
   - **Pass 2**: All ones (`0xFF`)
   - **Pass 3**: Random data patterns

### Technical Specifications
- **Main Storage Bombs**: 1MB per bomb (optimized for HDDs/SSDs)
- **Pendrive Bombs**: 512KB per bomb (optimized for flash storage)
- **Concurrent Threads**: Up to 16 for main storage, 8 for pendrives
- **Direct I/O**: No buffering, immediate hardware writes
- **Real-time Progress**: Live bomb detonation tracking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Warnings

> **üö® DANGER: DATA DESTRUCTION IS PERMANENT AND IRREVERSIBLE**

### Before Using:
1. **Verify device names** carefully - wrong device = data loss
2. **Backup critical data** - operations cannot be undone
3. **Run as Administrator** - required for device access
4. **Test on non-critical devices** first
5. **Close all applications** using target device

### Legal & Ethical Use:
- Only use on devices you own
- Comply with local data destruction laws
- Consider environmental disposal regulations
- Document destruction for compliance audits

## üìä Monitoring & Progress

### Real-time Status
Monitor bomb detonation progress:
```bash
GET /wipe-status/your_wipe_id
```

### Sample Progress Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "wipe_status": {
    "status": "placing_bombs",
    "device": "Primary SSD (512GB)",
    "progress": 65.4,
    "total_bombs": 524288,
    "completed_bombs": 342814,
    "device_size_mb": 512000
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Bomb Size Adjustment
```python
# In boom_wipe_app.py
self.bomb_size = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB bombs

# In pendrive_wipe_app.py  
self.bomb_size = 512 * 1024   # 512KB bombs
```

### Thread Limits
```python
max_threads = min(16, total_bombs)  # Main storage
max_threads = min(8, total_bombs)   # Pendrives
```

### Overwrite Passes
```python
self.overwrite_passes = 3  # Standard: 3 passes
```
